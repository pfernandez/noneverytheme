<h1>Controlling Processing with a MIDI Keyboard in Ubuntu</h1>
<div class="blogpost">
<p>
One of the coolest things about taking Interactive Digital Arts at the
University of Oregon this spring was being introduced to the 
<a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a>
programming environment. It's open source, easy to get started with,
and provides the simplest way I've seen to quickly get interactive
animations up on the screen. I've been interested in experimental
music since forever, and lately I've been thinking about ways to
combine sound with visualizations in a way that is immediately
immersive and intuitive to use, while at the same time being more
interactive than, say, an ITunes animation using beat detection.</p>

<h2>The Hardware</h2>

<p>
For this project I wanted to focus on controllers; something that I
could use to interact with both sound and visuals simulataneously. I
thought about building a custom controller using an Arduino or maybe
a hacked computer keyboard, and while both could produce really
unique results, they wouldn't be very flexible or reproducible
without an awful lot of work. I also considered using a Wiimote, but
while someone <em>has</em> written a Wiimote library, it seemed very 'alpha.'
I wanted something solid and useable without a lot of headaches. It
took me two days to realize that I had a dusty M-Audio Oxygen49 MIDI
keyboard leaning up against the side of my desk the whole time!

<p>
It's got rows of assignable rotary knobs, buttons and sliders, and
although it wasn't immediately clear just how those would translate
to manipulation of graphics on a comupter screen, there was enough
suggestion of possiblity to be exciting.
</p>

<h2>The Software</h2>

<p>A little googling yeilded the materials I needed: a solid Processing 
library called
<a href="http://ruinwesen.com/blog?id=95">rwmidi</a>
with decent 
<a href="http://ruinwesen.com/support-files/rwmidi/documentation/sketch1.html">documentation</a>. 
I also found a good example of how it might be used, and what the corresponding 
<a href="https://github.com/mistercrunch/MidiVisualization">code</a>
might look like. Although this isn't quite how <em>I</em> imaginged using it,
it's pretty darn cool nonetheless. Check it out:</p>

<p>
There was no guarantee that it was going to work on my favored OS, Ubuntu
11.10, but after dropping it into my newly created sketchbook ->
libraries folder, I was good to go (installing Processing on Ubuntu
in the first place was another matter; for more on that, start 
<a href="http://forum.processing.org/#topic/25080000000022092">here</a>.
I had to replace Processing's included Java package with the 
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">latest
version</a> 
from the Sun website.)
</p>

<h2>The Code</h2>

<p>
I needed a good code snippet to get started with, so I grabbed the sample
code on the rwmidi website, and toyed with it until I got all of the
functionality I was looking for.</p>

<pre>
import rwmidi.*;

MidiInput input;
MidiOutput output;
int maxNote = 84;
int minNote = 36;
int numNotes = maxNote-minNote;
int notePlayed = (maxNote+minNote)/2;

void setup() {
  size(800, 600);
  background(notePlayed);
  println(&quot;Midi device list:&quot;);
  println(RWMidi.getInputDeviceNames());
  input = RWMidi.getInputDevices()[0].createInput(this);
  output = RWMidi.getOutputDevices()[0].createOutput();
  println(&quot;Input: &quot; + input.getName());
  println(&quot;Output: &quot; + output.getName());
}

void noteOnReceived(Note note) {
  notePlayed = note.getPitch();
  println(&quot;Note on: &quot; + note.getPitch() + &quot;, velocity: &quot; + note.getVelocity());
}

void noteOffReceived(Note note) {
  println(&quot;Note off: &quot; + note.getPitch());
}

void controllerChangeReceived(Controller controller) {
  println(&quot;CC: &quot; + controller.getCC() + &quot;, value: &quot; + controller.getValue());
}

void draw() {
  background(255*(notePlayed-minNote)/(numNotes));
}
</pre>

<h2>The Results</h2>

<p>
Basically I just wanted to get Processing to show a number every 
time I pressed a key, twiddled a knob, etc. Later I can use those
input values to control, say, the diameter of a sphere or height 
of a sine wave. In MIDI, the input values are integers that vary 
from 0 to 127.  Here's what the output looks like on Processing's 
command line:

</br>
<p>
My test script also has a very simple "draw" command that changes
the window to a different shade of gray depending on which key 
is pressed. Here's "middle C:"

<p>
Still not quite an "immersive visual experience," I admit. 
Looks like it's time to get creative!
